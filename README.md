# TIME-SERIES-FORECAST-\_

## WELCOME TO MY REPO WHERE I'D TAKE YOU THROUGH MY STEP TO STEP OF TIME SERIES MODELS UNDERSTANGING.

**What is Time series Analysis**
A sequnce of observations over a certain period, Its a random sequence recorded in a time ordered fasion

**Applications of Time series**
Basically anywhere time is in a time ordered fashion
eg - Economis : Making stock marhet predictions - Social Sciences : Population Series, Birth rates, enrollments etc - Epidemiology : check for disease cases over time eg covid - In Medicine : eg to trace suger levels over time for a patient

## Types of Time Series

a) **Univariate Time series** - Consists of values taken in by a single variable at a periodic time instances of a period.

b) **Multivariate Time series** - Consists of values taken in by multiple variables at a periodic time instances over a period.

## Tools to use here

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. SciPy (Science Python)
5. Atleast one visualizing library (maplotlib, seaborn or plotly)
6. datetime library - Has 2 modules datetime and calender

## TIME SERIES MODELS TO GO THROUGH

1. AR MODELS
2. MA MODELS
3. ARIMA MODELS
4. SARIMA MODELS
5. SARIMAX MODELS

## IMPORTANCE OF TIME SERIES :watch:

**Time series forecasting models play a vital role in decision-making across a wide range of industries and applications. They enable organizations to make more informed, data-driven decisions, improve resource allocation, and plan for the future effectively.**

1.**Business Planning**: Time series forecasting helps businesses make informed decisions by predicting future trends in sales, demand, and revenue. This aids in inventory management, resource allocation, and financial planning.

2. **Resource Allocation**: Companies can use time series forecasts to allocate resources efficiently. For example, a manufacturing company can adjust production levels based on demand forecasts to avoid overproduction or stockouts.

3. **Financial Markets**: In finance, time series forecasting is crucial for predicting stock prices, interest rates, and exchange rates. Traders and investors use these forecasts to make investment decisions and manage risk.

4. **Energy Management**: Time series forecasting is used in the energy sector to predict electricity demand, optimize energy production, and improve the efficiency of power generation and distribution.

5. **Weather Forecasting**: Meteorologists use time series models to predict weather patterns, temperature, precipitation, and other climate-related variables. This information is vital for agriculture, transportation, and disaster preparedness.

6. **Healthcare**: In healthcare, time series forecasting is employed to predict patient admission rates, disease outbreaks, and the demand for medical supplies. It helps hospitals and healthcare providers plan for contingencies.

7. **Environmental Monitoring**: Time series forecasting is used to predict environmental variables such as air quality, water quality, and pollution levels. This data is used for environmental management and policy development.

8. **Supply Chain Management**: Companies rely on time series forecasting to optimize their supply chains. It helps in determining the right quantities of raw materials, components, and finished products to maintain smooth operations.

9. **Traffic and Transportation**: Time series models can predict traffic patterns, public transportation demand, and congestion levels. This information is valuable for urban planning and transportation infrastructure management.

10. **Marketing and Sales**: Marketers use time series forecasting to predict customer behavior, sales trends, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. This aids in marketing strategy development and budget allocation.

11. **Quality Control**: Time series forecasting can be applied to monitor and control product quality in manufacturing processes, helping to identify defects and maintain consistent product quality.

12. **Economic Policy**: Governments and central banks use time series models to forecast economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment rates. These forecasts inform monetary and fiscal policy decisions.

13. **Customer Service**: Companies use time series forecasting to predict customer service demand, allowing them to allocate resources and staff efficiently to handle customer inquiries and issues.

14. **Risk Management**: Time series forecasting is crucial in risk assessment and management. It helps in identifying potential risks and developing strategies to mitigate them.

15. **Scientific Research**: Time series analysis is used in various scientific fields to model and predict phenomena like climate change, population growth, and the spread of diseases.
